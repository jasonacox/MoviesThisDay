# MoviesThisDay Release Notes

## v0.1.12 (2025-07-26)
- SEO: Added meta tags (description, keywords, Open Graph, Twitter Card) and JSON-LD structured data to homepage for improved search engine discoverability and rich previews.
- Static assets: Added `static/` directory and now serve static files (including `og-image.png`) via FastAPI and Docker.
- Docker: Dockerfile now copies the `static/` directory for static asset support in containers.
- Favicon: Improved `gen_favicon.py` to write PNG output, prompt before overwrite, and document usage; favicon is now generated from `static/icon.png` and saved as `static/favicon.png`.
- Accessibility: Improved all main templates (`index.html`, `details.html`, `search.html`) so that movie poster images use descriptive alt text and, if the poster fails to load, a local placeholder image is shown and the alt text updates to "No poster available" for accessibility and a better user experience.
- Version bump to 0.1.12 in `app.py` and documentation.
- General: Updated documentation, release notes, and ensured all new features and fixes are reflected in the codebase.

## v0.1.11 (2025-07-26)

- Improved build output: Phase headers now print with clear dividers, and all status messages are consistently formatted for readability.
- Trending and new release movies are always included in the main index, regardless of release date.
- Homepage date navigation: Improved date handling and navigation logic for the date picker and navigation buttons. The calendar now always uses the user's local date, and navigation between days/months is robust to month/year overflow. The client_date parameter is always set and updated automatically for timezone consistency.
- Documentation updated to reflect new build logic, API optimizations, and UI date handling.
- Minor code cleanup and maintainability improvements.

## v0.1.10 (2025-06-26)

- Minor About page JavaScript and UI/UX improvements for maintainability and accuracy.
- Added Movie Ratings (e.g. G, PG, PG-13) display and controls to homepage and search.

- About page: Added two modern Chart.js bar graphs (movies by day, movies by rating) with improved color, gradient, and month labeling. Displayed total and popular movie counts above the graphs.
- UI/UX: Improved About and Search pages for compactness, clarity, and mobile usability. Search results now show rating under release date, and filter logic is more advanced.

## v0.1.7 (2025-06-20)
- Trending/new release movies are now always included in the main index table, regardless of release date.
- Added server-side detection of "New Release" (released within last 3 months) for all movies; badge appears in both the main table and hover card.

- Added `/details/{imdb_id}` route and details page: full movie info, poster, ratings, and correction form.
- Correction form now posts to a configurable file via the `CORRECTIONS_FILE` environment variable (default: `/data/corrections.jsonl`).
